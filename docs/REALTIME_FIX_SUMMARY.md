# Realtime Connection Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Multiple Subscription Error
**Problem**: "tried to subscribe multiple times. 'subscribe' can only be called a single time per channel instance"
**Cause**: React StrictMode double-mounting components causing duplicate subscriptions
**Solution**: 
- Added `isSubscribing` state to prevent concurrent subscription attempts
- Created ConnectionManager to handle deduplication and cleanup
- Added proper cleanup scheduling to handle StrictMode unmount/remount

### 2. Database Connection Error
**Problem**: "Realtime was unable to connect to the project database"
**Cause**: Missing authentication token in channel configuration
**Solution**:
- Added JWT token to channel params for proper authentication
- Made channel creation async to fetch current session
- Added fallback to load data even if realtime fails

## Key Changes

### ConnectionManager (`connection-manager.ts`)
- Manages subscription deduplication
- Handles cleanup with delay for StrictMode
- Prevents duplicate channel creation

### ManagedChannel Updates
- Added `isSubscribing` state to prevent race conditions
- Made channel creation async for auth token
- Better error handling and state management

### Provider Updates
- Uses ConnectionManager for subscription deduplication
- Proper cleanup on unmount with delay
- Continues to load data even if realtime fails

## Result
- No more multiple subscription errors
- Graceful fallback when realtime fails
- Works properly with React StrictMode
- Maintains realtime functionality when connection succeeds
